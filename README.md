### Here are some cool projects that I'm currently working on:

- [X] [EmBoxd](https://github.com/computer-geek64/emboxd) - Live sync server for updating Letterboxd with movies watched on Emby
- [X] [Frigate](https://gitea.ashishdsouza.com/ashish/frigate) - Open-source NVR software with AI object detection, deployed as a home surveillance system. I developed a finely-tuned notification system on top of Frigate, as well as a secondary API to implement additional controls via the web. While I did not make Frigate itself, I use it as the successor to my [Guardian](https://github.com/computer-geek64/guardian/tree/develop) project (which I developed from scratch) due to its superior machine learning features that provide more accurate event detection (Guardian relied solely on motion detection and had too many false positives).
