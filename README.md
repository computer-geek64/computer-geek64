# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech and an SDE Intern at Amazon

### These are some of my favorite projects:

- [X] [Fizz](https://github.com/computer-geek64/fizz) - Fizz is an interactive personal financial consultant perfect for providing the beginning investor with insight rivaling that of financial experts. Fizz was developed at HackGT 7 and won the BlackRock challenge.

- [X] [Blackout](https://github.com/computer-geek64/blackout) - An automated Git history rewriter for sensitive information 

- [X] [Firestorm](https://github.com/computer-geek64/firestorm) - My personal headless CentOS 8 server with a custom-built web interface

- [X] [TimeLock](https://github.com/computer-geek64/timelock) - A time-lock encryption program, which relies on a verified time server source to prevent falsified decryption attempts.

- [X] [Covid-19 Survival Calculator](https://github.com/computer-geek64/covid19-survival-calculator) - A survival probability calculator for the Coronavirus, made for the COVID-19 Global Hackathon.

- [X] [ALRT](https://github.com/computer-geek64/alrt) - ALRT (Automated Life Rescue Tracker) is an application that aims to tackle the challenge of finding victims of natural disasters when weather conditions cause power and connection loss. This was made for the Swamphacks VI Hackathon.

- [X] [MileSnap](https://github.com/computer-geek64/milesnap) - MileSnap is an application that allows a user to take a picture of a gas station pricing sign and recieve the fuel type and its corresponding price. MileSnap was developed at HackGT 6 and won the PDI Challenge.

### Here are some other cool projects I'm currently working on:
